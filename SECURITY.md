## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our project secure.  

If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps: 

1. **Contact Us** – Report vulnerabilities via [security@example.com](mailto:raizetvision@gmail.com). Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and release a fix.  
2. **Provide Details** – Include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce (if applicable), and any potential impact.  
3. **Response Time** – We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and will provide updates on our investigation progress at least once every **7 days**.  
4. **Resolution Process** – If confirmed, we will work on a fix and notify you once a patch is available. Credit may be given based on disclosure policies.  
5. **Public Disclosure** – Once a fix is released, we will coordinate public disclosure with the reporter when possible.
